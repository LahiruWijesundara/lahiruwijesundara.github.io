<p align="justify">
Iâ€™m a Gameplay programmer and researcher with a master's degree in Commercial Games Development from the University of the West of England, United Kingdom and over seven years of game industry experience specialising in Unreal Engine and Unity.
<br>
<br>
My research interests span several areas, including <strong><em>Video Game AI, Player Modelling, Game Analytics, Player Behaviour Analysis, Game User Research, and Human Computer Interaction and Extended Reality</em></strong>. Notably, I've conducted comparative research on Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) reinforcement learning algorithms using Unity ML-Agents and developed serious games that address real-world challenges, such as transport decarbonisation.
<br>
<br>
Passionate about bridging academia and industry, I actively explore innovative methods to enhance player experiences through intelligent system design and data-driven insights. My goal is to continue pushing the boundaries of interactive gaming technologies and make meaningful contributions to player-centric game development research.
