Blood Reckoning is a dark-fantasy MMORPG made by gamers for gamers. Set in a realm shattered by the appearance of Blood Stones, it blends ancient technology, sorcery, demons, angels, elves, dwarves, and desperate humans struggling to survive. This over-18-only world embraces mature stories, nudity, and grim themes. PvP-centric combat offers unique, limited-edition skills and weapons—true one-offs earned through exploration, puzzle-solving, or rare NPC encounters.

I'm leading the team to design and implement gameplay mechanics utilizing Unreal Engine's Gameplay Framework, ensuring robust and maintainable systems. Designed and developed a comprehensive player data-saving solution by integrating Unreal's built-in save system with MongoDB for persistent and efficient storage. Implemented a versatile combat system, incorporating both melee and ranged attack mechanics to enhance player interaction. Additionally, designed and implemented sophisticated enemy AI behaviors using Unreal Engine's AI framework, delivering engaging and challenging gameplay experiences.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
