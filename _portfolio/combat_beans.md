Combat Beans: Total Mayhem is a fun and chaotic third-person shooter that combines "Fall Guys" party game elements with intense combat mechanics. The game is available on Steam and features dynamic multiplayer gameplay.
<br>
<br>
I led the team to design and implement advanced gameplay mechanics using the Unreal Engine Gameplay framework, architected the combat system and player inventory, and enabled dynamically scalable servers and matchmaking through Microsoft Azure PlayFab.
