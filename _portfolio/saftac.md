SAF-TAC is a VR/Desktop multiplayer application designed specifically for military simulation and training with essential simulation functions such as Exercise Control, Scenario Authoring and After-Action Review.
<br>
<br>
Contributed to creating complex systems and enhancing gameplay experiences using the Unreal engine gameplay framework and Agile methodologies in a highly dynamic, talented team of programmers, game designers, QA engineers and artists. Developed multiplayer mechanics and optimized network performance using Unreal Engine, including server-side logic and AI systems. Created a full-body VR avatar system with inverse kinematics and implemented a weather control system for enhanced user experience. Led technical optimization efforts, worked closely with cross-functional teams, and mentored junior developers.
